# FSCockpit  
My setup for a flight sim cockpit  
  
## Current guidelines  
What I'm currently attempting to achieve. These guidelines come as conclusions of previous thought.  
  
- Start by making discrete components, not a big one. i.e. make a specific component to manage comm radio1, another for comm radio2, another for nav1, another for autopilot, etc.  
- Start by a single component and make it work.  


## Change log  
2022-04-19: I create this github repo to keep all the project stuff in one place.
